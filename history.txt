Version 0.1 - first released version

Version 0.2

- Server scanning is now done directly via TCP/IP, not via DirectPlay. The result -
  it's now nearly instantaneous and DirectX 6.0 problem is gone. The interfaces is
  also slightly changed (progress indicator is gone as it isn't needed anymore, etc).
- Added progress indicatiors for server list downloads.
- Added Outlaws support, including Winsock protocol.
- Added automatic level downloading (only for JK and MOTS, not Outlaws yet) - if you 
  try to connect to a server which runs a level you don't have, ReconDroid offers you
  to download and unzip the level to add-on directoty (which you can specify. By 
  default it's the "Episode" directory).
